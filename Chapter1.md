# Computer Vision Notes

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Vision

### 1.1 What is Computer Vision?
- **Definition**: Computer Vision (CV) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science focused on enabling computers to interpret, analyze, and understand visual information from digital images or videos.
- **Goal**: Replicate the capabilities of human vision, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and motion analysis, but in an automated, scalable, and often more precise way.

### 1.2 Key Questions in Computer Vision
- **What is in the image?** (Recognition)
- **Where is it located?** (Detection)
- **How is it structured?** (Segmentation)
- **How does it change over time?** (Tracking & Motion Analysis)
- **What 3D information can we extract?** (3D Reconstruction, Depth Estimation)

### 1.3 Applications of Computer Vision
- **Healthcare**: Tumor detection, X-ray and MRI analysis
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Lane detection, pedestrian detection, traffic sign recognition
- **Security & Surveillance**: Face recognition, anomaly detection
- **Agriculture**: Crop monitoring, disease detection
- **Retail & E-commerce**: Visual product search, virtual try-on
- **Industry & Manufacturing**: Quality control, defect detection
- **AR/VR**: Gesture recognition, scene reconstruction

### 1.4 Key Components of a Computer Vision System
1. **Image Acquisition**
   - Capturing images using cameras, sensors, or other imaging devices.
2. **Preprocessing**
   - Enhancing image quality, noise removal, normalization.
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Identifying edges, textures, corners, or deep features.
4. **Interpretation**
   - Applying algorithms or models to classify, detect, or segment objects.

### 1.5 Challenges in Computer Vision
- **Lighting Variations**: Same object appears different under varying light.
- **Occlusion**: Objects may be partially hidden.
- **Viewpoint Variability**: Different camera angles change appearance.
- **Scale Variability**: Objects appear differently depending on distance.
- **Intra-class Variability**: Large variation within the same class (e.g., different dog breeds).
- **Real-Time Processing**: Many applications (e.g., autonomous driving) require low-latency performance.

### 1.6 Relation with Other Fields
- **Image Processing**: Focuses on enhancing images (low-level vision).
- **Computer Graphics**: Generating images (inverse of CV).
- **Machine Learning**: Provides algorithms for pattern recognition in CV.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: CV is a subfield of AI.

### 1.7 Summary
- Computer Vision is about teaching machines to interpret visual data.
- It combines image processing, machine learning, and AI techniques.
- It has a wide range of real-world applications and challenges.
- Forms the foundation for advanced technologies like AR/VR, autonomous systems, and medical imaging.
