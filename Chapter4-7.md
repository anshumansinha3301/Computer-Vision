# Chapters 4–7: Features, Segmentation, Object Detection & Classification

## Chapter 4: Feature Extraction

### 4.1 Introduction
- **Definition**: Feature extraction involves detecting and describing meaningful information (edges, corners, textures) from an image for further tasks like recognition or matching.
- **Goal**: Reduce image data while preserving essential information.

---

### 4.2 Edge Detection
- **Edges**: Significant local changes in image intensity.
- **Operators**:
  - Sobel operator: Computes gradient in x and y directions.
  - Prewitt operator: Similar to Sobel, simpler.
  - Canny edge detector: Multi-stage algorithm (noise reduction, gradient, non-maximum suppression, hysteresis thresholding).

---

### 4.3 Corner and Keypoint Detection
- **Harris Corner Detector**: Identifies corners by analyzing intensity variation in all directions.
- **FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test)**: Quick corner detection.
- **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**: Combines FAST and BRIEF with rotation invariance.

---

### 4.4 Feature Descriptors
- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**: Robust to scale, rotation, and illumination.
- **SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)**: Faster alternative to SIFT.
- **BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)**: Binary descriptor, computationally efficient.

---

### 4.5 HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
- Captures gradient orientation histograms.
- Widely used in human detection and object recognition.

## Chapter 5: Image Segmentation

### 5.1 Introduction
- **Definition**: Partitioning an image into meaningful regions (objects, background).
- **Goal**: Simplify representation and make analysis easier.

---

### 5.2 Segmentation Techniques
1. **Thresholding-Based**
   - Global, Otsu’s, Adaptive thresholding.
2. **Region-Based**
   - Region growing, Region splitting & merging, Watershed algorithm.
3. **Edge-Based**
   - Uses edge detectors (Canny, Sobel) to define boundaries.
4. **Clustering-Based**
   - K-Means clustering, Mean-Shift algorithm.
5. **Graph-Based**
   - Models image as a graph; partitioned into regions.
6. **Deep Learning-Based**
   - U-Net, Mask R-CNN, DeepLab.

### 5.3 Evaluation Metrics
- Dice coefficient
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Boundary matching metrics

## Chapter 6: Object Detection

### 6.1 Introduction
- **Definition**: Identifying and localizing objects in an image.
- **Difference from Classification**: Classification labels an entire image, detection finds objects + locations.

---

### 6.2 Traditional Methods
- **Sliding Window**: Apply classifier over multiple sub-regions.
- **Viola-Jones Algorithm**:
  - Uses Haar-like features.
  - Cascade of classifiers for face detection.

---

### 6.3 Modern Deep Learning Methods
- **R-CNN (Region-based CNN)**
  - Uses selective search for region proposals.
- **Fast R-CNN**
  - Improves speed by using RoI pooling.
- **Faster R-CNN**
  - Region Proposal Network (RPN) replaces selective search.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
  - Single-shot detector, real-time.
- **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)**
  - Multi-scale feature maps.
- **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)**
  - Transformer-based end-to-end detection.

---

### 6.4 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Average Precision (mAP)
- Precision-Recall curves

---

## Chapter 7: Image Classification

### 7.1 Introduction
- **Definition**: Assigning a label to an entire image.
- **Applications**: Handwriting recognition, medical imaging, scene classification.

---

### 7.2 Traditional Approaches
- Extract handcrafted features (HOG, SIFT).
- Apply classifiers like:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - Random Forest

---

### 7.3 Deep Learning Approaches
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
  - Convolutions for feature extraction.
  - Pooling for dimensionality reduction.
  - Fully connected layers for classification.
- **Popular Architectures**:
  - LeNet, AlexNet (early CNNs).
  - VGGNet, ResNet, InceptionNet (modern deeper CNNs).

---

### 7.4 Transfer Learning
- Using pre-trained models on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet).
- Fine-tuning or feature extraction for specific tasks.

---

### 7.5 Evaluation Metrics
